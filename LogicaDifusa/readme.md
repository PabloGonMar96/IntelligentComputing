# Rule-based Systems

Rule-based systems work by applying rules, comparing results and applying new rules based on modified situations. They can also work by directed logical inference, either starting with initial evidence in a given situation and moving towards obtaining a solution, or with hypotheses about possible solutions and going back to find existing evidence (or a deduction from a existing evidence) that supports a particular hypothesis.
